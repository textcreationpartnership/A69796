            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>AMongſt the Mountains of this Peninſula is reckoned that of <hi>Foloe,</hi> near which was once ſituated the City of <hi>Olympia,</hi> ſo much famed by the Poets for the Country of the Centaurs. The riſe of this name was thus, <hi>Hercules</hi> having ſlain the <hi>Nemaean</hi> Lyon, and being Victorious over the <hi>Lernaean</hi> Hydra, and the Boar of <hi>Ery<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manthus,</hi> happened to go to this Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, where he retired into the Cave of the Centaur <hi>Foloeus,</hi> who treated him with a great deal of Civility, and entertained him with excellent Wine which he kept there hid from the reſt of the Centaurs; it chanced while they were thus Carouſing, ſome other Centaurs paſſing by, were drawn by the ſmell of the Wine, and running to the Den endeavoured to enter by Violence. <hi>Foloeus</hi>'s chief en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour was for an hiding place, ſo that <hi>Hercules</hi> was left alone to engage with all the Centaurs; he then playd his beſt, and gave them ſuch terrible
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:54441:13"/>
Effects of his Rage, that having killed ſome, the reſt betook themſelves to flight to carry away a wretched Life. The Combat ended, <hi>Foloeus</hi> crept out of his hole, and ſufficiently admired the Valour of his Gueſt; but by miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune handling the Arrow where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with <hi>Hercules</hi> killed the <hi>Hydra,</hi> he let one of them fall on his Foot, the wound was ſo deep that he fell down and dyed on the ſpot; <hi>Hercules</hi> much grieved at this accident, and in ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement of his kind Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment buried him in his own Cave, and named the Mountain from his name <hi>Foloeus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The other moſt noted Mountains are <hi>Cyllene, Lyceus, Parthenius, Menalus,</hi> and <hi>Sepia;</hi> of all theſe <hi>Cyllenius</hi> is the higheſt, 'tis near that of <hi>Calidoria,</hi> at the Top whereof are yet to be ſeen the remains of the Temple of <hi>Mercury,</hi> from thence called <hi>Cyllenius;</hi> yet ſome will have that name to be derived from <hi>Cyllenus</hi> Son of <hi>Aleates.</hi> The Mountain <hi>Lyceus</hi> taking its beginning in <hi>Zaconia,</hi> is memorable for the place where the Tyrant <hi>Ariſtarchus</hi> was made an offering to the publick Rage of the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:54441:13"/>
                     <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> who there ſtoned him.

Mount <hi>Sepia</hi> is that where, as <hi>Pauſanias</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports, <hi>Epites,</hi> the Son of <hi>Eleates</hi> was ſtung to death by a Serpent. The <hi>Duché</hi> of <hi>Chiarenza</hi> has on the North the Mountain now called <hi>Poglizi</hi> from <hi>Diana's</hi> Temple which once adorned it; it was at firſt named <hi>Geronte,</hi> then <hi>Skinfale</hi> from the name of a Nymph, the Daughter of <hi>Arcas,</hi> or from certain large Birds of Prey called <hi>Stymphalides,</hi> that live in theſe quarters in great flocks: Theſe devoured Men, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they were either chaſed away, or the Species quite deſtroyed by the ſlaughter <hi>Hercules</hi> made of them.</p>
                  <p>On the Eaſt ſide between <hi>Saccania</hi> and <hi>Tzaconia</hi> lyes Mount <hi>Cronie</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly called <hi>Grevenos,</hi> on whoſe far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſt Northern part ſtood the Temple of <hi>Lucina</hi> and <hi>Feſipoli,</hi> ſo named from
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:54441:14"/>
the Idol to which the <hi>Eleans</hi> offered Sacrifices. Where is found the Stone called a <hi>Cylinder</hi> which may be taken from the Rock, when the thunder rumbling in the Clouds cauſes an agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the Air.</p>
                  <p>In the Province of <hi>Belvedere</hi> Mount <hi>Mintia</hi> or <hi>Mente</hi> now <hi>Olonos</hi> comes in view; its South has a Proſpect of the Gulf of <hi>Coron,</hi> on the North riſes the River <hi>Alpheus;</hi> it took its name from <hi>Pluto</hi>'s Miſtreſs, when <hi>Proſerpina</hi> Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous of her Husband, ſought after her and found her in this place, and chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged her into the Herb Mint, a great quantity of which grows wild on this Mountain; and in Memory of this Act of the Infernal Goddeſs, the proud Fanes of <hi>Pluto</hi> and <hi>Proſerpina</hi> once ſtood there.</p>
                  <p>The little Mount <hi>Neris</hi> lifts it ſelf up in <hi>Saccania</hi> and <hi>Nonacris</hi> in <hi>Tzaconia,</hi> at the foot whereof roul the fatal Waves of <hi>Styx,</hi> fatal to thoſe that taſte the otherwiſe clear and tempting Stream. The Poets make this one of the infernal Rivers; <hi>Inachus</hi> alſo has its ſource in this Province. There is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe Mount <hi>Artemiſius,</hi> thought to be

                  <p>The moſt conſiderable and famous of all the <hi>Grecian</hi> Mountains, and that which <hi>Polybius</hi> compares with the <hi>Alpes</hi> is <hi>Taygeta,</hi> bearing another name now of <hi>Orta,</hi> it extends it ſelf in the Province of <hi>Tzaconia</hi> not far from the River <hi>Taenarus,</hi> very near the <hi>Eurotas</hi> that runs by <hi>Miſitra;</hi> 'tis ſtockt with Deer, Bears, Boars and other wild Beaſts: It took its name from <hi>Taygeta,</hi> the Daughter of <hi>Lacedaemon,</hi> who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing raviſht by <hi>Jupiter,</hi> out of ſhame and grief for her loſt Virginity, killed her ſelf there.

of diſperſed Fugitives and others got together from ſeveral parts of the Kingdom; or ſent from the Turkiſh Army, came down, ſo that they were conſiderably encreaſed; and then they thought upon the readieſt means to procure a ſpeedy deliverance of the place.

                  <p>After this blow, which was not a little advantagious to us, our General making Reflection, that the Enemies were often refreſht with new Supplies, to the great diſadvantage of his own Men, whereof he had loſt a great number, without any hopes of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cruiting them, he at laſt concluded that the whole Succeſs depended upon the Defeat of the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Camp; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he applyed himſelf to whatever might contribute to make this At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt

of the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Army, and we loſt but forty of our Men, yet all theſe loſſes would not abate the Turkiſh Pride, and bring them to yield; for they knew where to gather a recruit of freſh Troops, and omitted not daily to diſturb the <hi>Venetians</hi> in their Tren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches. Theſe frequent Attacks had much leſſened our Men, who were beſides much harraſed with continual Action; ſo that doubtleſs 'twas very needful for the General to encourage them, which he did, ſhewing himſelf a fearleſs Example of Valour, being the firſt in all Dangers and fatigues.</p>
                  <p>In the end this prudent Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der finding the only means to reduce the place, was to force the Enemys Camp, propoſed the Deſign to the Council of War, which was appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of by them. He drew out of the Gallies 1500 Voluntiers, who under the Command of Lieutenant Colonel <hi>Magnani</hi> landed about Mid-night, and next day being the <hi>7th.</hi> of <hi>Auguſt</hi> 1200 of them filed off to the left of the Enemys Retrenchments by the Entrance of a Valley, and the reſt of them went to the right; at the

ſame time the other Troops had or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to follow their Motions, to be ready to give them a ſpeedy Succour at neceſſary places, ſo to favour and promote the deſign.</p>
                  <p>Twilight of the next Morning be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing come, two Barrels of Powder were fired, as a Signal, which was immediately followed with a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of all the Cannon, and ſurious Salvo of all the Musketeers, with a continual ſiring on the Front and Flank of the Enemies Camp. This brisk and unexpected Aſſault put the Turks into an extream diſorder, and the forwardeſt of them began to give back and ſly, without being able to be retained by the Example of the moſt fearleſs, or the Commands of their Officers; all yield, and the <hi>Venetians</hi> find no more reſiſtance, but make a continual Butchery of the Turks, ſcarce any eſcaping their Swords. The Event was ſuch, that the Victory which the <hi>Venetians</hi> gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in a very ſhort time, was accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with the entire Defeat of their Enemies, and the Ground was all co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with dead and dying Men,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:54441:56"/>
and Streams of the unbelieving Blood ran down; in this Action but few of the Chriſtians were loſt or wounded.</p>
                  <p>A very rich Booty was found in the Turks Camp of Artillery, Arms, Ammunition and Proviſion, with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove 300 Horſes, Tents, Standards, ſix Braſs Guns, three whereof were marked with St. <hi>Mark</hi> of <hi>Venice,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides theſe the Imperial Standard a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorned with Horſe Tails, the mark of a general Command and a nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Army.</p>
                  <p>By the order of the Senate this Monument of their Victory was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned for the Church of the <hi>Tolen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tins</hi> of <hi>Venice,</hi> to be there for ever expoſed to the Eyes of the People, over the Altar of St. <hi>Gaetan,</hi> as an Eternal Memorial that this Saints Feſtival was the day whereon the <hi>Venetians</hi> had ſo Glorious a Succeſs againſt the Infidels; and at the ſame time it was Decreed that every year on the ſame day, this Feſtival ſhould be kept with all the Solemnity poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, conformable to what was then done.

                  <p>The Figure which we have given repreſents the Magnificence of the Standard, and form of the Batons and Tails; the whole was deſigned and graved with ſo much care and exactneſs, that one who has the Skill of Blazonry, will eaſily comprehend not only its Grandeur, but likewiſe the Colours of this Standard; wherefore 'tis needleſs to particulariſe it here: It was thought beſt to oblige the Curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous with the interpretation of the Turkiſh Characters that make the Moon, and the Faces of the Lance on the end of the Standard.</p>

The Turks ſhew theſe Tails as a ſign of their Reſolution, to make new Levies, and that a great Army will march; and afterwards they give them to him that is to be the Commander in chief, as a ſign of good Augury. This Cuſtom took its riſe amongſt them, from an Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture that happened to them, when they firſt began to eſtabliſh their Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannick Rule out of their own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. In a Battel their Enemy made 6000 of them Priſoners, who took occaſion to throw off the Victors Yoak, and ſet themſelves at Liberty; and wanting Standards to range themſelves under, they thought upon, and made uſe of ſome Horſes Tails for that purpoſe, ſince which time they have ſtill continued the Cuſtom; calculating the future by their firſt Succeſs, and think themſelves, under theſe Colours, able to deal with the moſt Couragious of their Enemies, and reſiſt their moſt furious Onſets. But as once when the <hi>Sabins,</hi> a proud and fierce People, planted their Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard in the Face of the <hi>Romans</hi> to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front them, with theſe words; <hi>Sabinis</hi>

There never was any Nation in the whole World that may be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to the <hi>Lacedaemonians</hi> for Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and they never had a King but one of their own People; and theſe People only have ſeen upon their Royal Throne two Virtuous and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving Heads circled with the ſame Diadem; and often amongſt them have been ſound Prodigies for Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and the Art of Governing, that they have been thought the only Politicians; and upon theſe Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations 'tis that it could endure and flouriſh 800 years; it declined in its Proſperity and Glory, when it loſt <hi>Colemanes</hi> the third King of that name.</p>

This their Deſign they communicated to <hi>Giov.

                     <p>As <hi>Porcacchi</hi> reports, the Iſle be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came ſubject to the Republick in the Year 1322. though <hi>Giov.

He ſo brought the buſineſs about, that he aſſembled the chief men of the place in the Church of the Convent, then called St. <hi>Angelo,</hi> and there cauſed the Keys of the Gates to be delivered into the hands of Captain <hi>Miani,</hi> with a grant of the Authority over the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. The Repreſentants of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick come every Year on the ſame day into this Church, accompanied
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:54441:97"/>
with the Body of the Officers, before whom the <hi>Protopapa</hi> renews the memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of this Action. I might add that the Prince has aſſigned to this Church, as a Mark of his acknowledgment to the Order, two Ducats, yearly to be taken out of the Fiſcale Chamber of <hi>Corfu.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Venetians</hi> were after this manner poſſeſſed of it, till the Year 1401. when <hi>Ladiſlaus</hi> King of <hi>Naples,</hi> the Son of <hi>Charles,</hi> for thirty thouſand Ducats left it quite free to the Republick.</p>
                     <p>It has been ſtill maintained under the <hi>Venetian</hi> Government, who have guard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and defended it, as a place very ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for the conſervation of their Empire by Sea; for it has ſeveral very good Ports where the Navy may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh it ſelf commodiouſly; beſides it has a convenient Situation for the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of the other Iſles and States of the <hi>Levant,</hi> and can hinder a great Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my from entring the Gulf, who will hardly venture to paſs by and leave ſo powerful an Enemy behind in ſo ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous a Poſt.

                     <p>On the North, the Iſle is all precepi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious and ſteep, and on the South covered with all ſorts of fruit-trees.

                     <p>ON the Weſt of the <hi>Archipelago</hi> lies the Iſle at this day commonly called <hi>Cerigo. Ptolemy</hi> named it <hi>Cythera</hi> from <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theron,</hi> the Son of <hi>Phenicus; Ariſtotle</hi> calls it <hi>Porphyruſa,</hi> from the great ſtore of <hi>Porphyry</hi> dug out of its Mountains; and others again <hi>Scothera.</hi> 'Tis juſt againſt the <hi>Laconian</hi> Gulf, but five miles off the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rea,</hi> forty from <hi>Candia,</hi> and has ſixty in circumference. It has ſeveral Rocks roundabout it, and good Ports on its ſides. On the South is the Port of the Fortreſs, which is but little frequented, becauſe 'tis but a narrow Bay, and lies much ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to the winds: The other, which is on the other ſide the <hi>Dragoniers,</hi> twelve miles from the Fortreſs, has a good bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom, is deep, and will contain a great Fleet: Above all things the natural ſhape of the Bay is wonderful, which may be ſhut up, and where forty Galleys may lie in ſafety. There is a Church dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to St. <hi>Nicholas,</hi> though no body dwells there. On the Weſt at 25 miles diſtance from this Port, there is another little one called <hi>San Nicolo de modari,</hi>
                        <pb n="180" facs="tcp:54441:126"/>
proper for <hi>Galliots</hi> and ſmall Barks, where is alſo a Church dedicated to St. <hi>Nicholas.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>There is in this Iſle great quantities of wild fowl, but little corn, wine or oyl; and food is there very dear. There are ſeveral Villages, but of ſmall or no account: And ſome Monaſteries of <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>romonachi</hi> and <hi>Caloierros,</hi> of which one ſtands upon a Rock on the right ſide near to the Fortreſs, which they call <hi>San Giovanni della Grotta.</hi> It has been hewn out of the Rock by pure labour with the mattock. Tho 'tis very diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult to get up to it; yet the <hi>Greeks</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe not that pains, when-ever the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious are to perform their Vows, which they have made to God. The ſteep points of the Rock, affright all that look on them, for they hang over ſo, that they threaten to fall and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelm thoſe that approach them. But for all this the Inhabitants have a great Veneration for the place, upon a belief, that St. <hi>John</hi> began his <hi>Apocalypſe</hi> there.</p>
                     <p>The City of the ſame name with the Iſle has the Title of a Biſhoprick: It ſtands upon a ſteep Rock in a very ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous ſituation, having towards the Sea an Eſplanade well mounted
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:54441:126"/>
with Canon, where they keep Guard.</p>
                     <p>The Republick of <hi>Venice</hi> has had the <note place="margin">Some ſay ever ſince the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpots of <hi>Greece.</hi>

                     <p>Some fabulous Writers ſay, that the Goddeſs <hi>Venus</hi> had her Birth in this place, others that ſhe paſſed her firſt days there. And was there ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged for a Goddeſs, and there was a beautiful Temple dedicated to her; under the name of <hi>Cytherea</hi> in the moſt Eaſtern part thereof: In which Temple was her Statue like a beautiful Woman holding in her right hand a Sea ſhell, and as if ready to leap into the Sea. She was all dreſſed with bluſhing Roſes and ſnowy Pidgeons flying around her, which ſeemed to follow and attend her motion. Three young Virgins, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenting the three Graces, hand in hand, went round her to ſerve her; two whereof were in action, as if they were
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:54441:127"/>
adorning her head, the third waited on her behind. Her Son <hi>Cupid</hi> was before her, armed with his bow, who, tho blind, yet wounded the God of Light, <hi>Apollo,</hi> with an Arrow from his bow.</p>
                     <p>'Twas in this Temple, that <hi>Paris,</hi> the amourous Son of <hi>Priam,</hi> met the fair <hi>Grecian Helen;</hi> and here they tempted each other to the fatal Rape, which armed the jealous <hi>Menelaus,</hi> and revenging <hi>Greece</hi> for the utter deſtruction of <hi>Troy.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Iſle is of no great extent, being not above ſixty miles; yet 'twas of great conſequence to the <hi>Spar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans,</hi> when they were Maſters of it; for it was to them as it were a Rampart and a ſhelter to their ſhips, which they ſent to <hi>Aegypt.</hi> They ſent thither eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry year a Preſident to regulate civil and military affairs; and the keeping of this Iſle was then ſo neceſſary, that in the eighth year of the <hi>Peleponneſian</hi> War, the <hi>Athenians</hi> having won it, <hi>Sparta</hi> was without defence, and its Country lay open to the Enemy, till they haſted to fortifie and put Garriſons in the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring places.</p>

                     <p>THE Iſle of <hi>Negropont</hi> is the moſt conſiderable of all the Iſles in the <hi>Archipelago.</hi> It has had divers Names, and that of <hi>Negropont</hi> has by corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on been changed into <hi>Egripont;</hi> the <hi>Turks</hi> call it <hi>Egribos,</hi> the Latins <hi>Euboea,</hi> either from the Retreat of the Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>Aſopus,</hi> or of <hi>Inachus</hi> thither, whom the Poets feign to be turned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Cow; which from its lowing is named <hi>Euboea.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It has alſo been called <hi>Macris</hi> from the Channel called ſo in Greek, <hi>Aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tias</hi> from the People <hi>Abantides, Calcis</hi> and <hi>Chalcondantis: Pliny</hi> likewiſe gives it the name of <hi>Aſopis,</hi> and <hi>Strabo</hi> ſays 'twas called <hi>Oche,</hi> and that once 'twas called <hi>Ellopia</hi> from <hi>Ellopus</hi> the Son of <hi>Jupiter.</hi>

Some have thought that this Iſle was once joyned to <hi>Boeotia,</hi> and thence ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated by Earth-quakes; or as others ſay, by the ſwift and impetuous courſe of the waves, which make the Canal called <hi>Euripus.</hi> The Iſle is three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred ſixty five miles round, in length, from <hi>South</hi> to <hi>North</hi> ninety miles, and forty broad, and twenty in the narrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt part. At which place it is joyned by a Bridge to the main Land.</p>
                     <p>It is, as it were, encompaſſed with two Promontories, <hi>Cape Lithar,</hi> and <hi>Cape dell' Oro.</hi> The firſt facing the Gulf of <hi>Volo</hi> is by <hi>Ptolemy</hi> and <hi>Strabo,</hi> called <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeum Promontorium,</hi> by <hi>Pliny Caeneum,</hi> and by <hi>Niger Canaia.</hi> Near this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>montory was the coaſt of <hi>Artemiſia,</hi> ſo called from a Temple of that name there erected: At which place the <hi>Greeks</hi> ſhelter'd their naval forces, during their wars with the King of <hi>Perſia.</hi> The ſecond looking toward the Eaſt part of the <hi>Archipelago, Ptolemy</hi> calls <hi>Caphare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um Promontorium, Sophianus Chymium, Niger Capo figera, Stephanus Cathereus, Lycophron Zarax, Iſacius Xylophagos.</hi> Upon the Top of this Promontory, <hi>Nauplius</hi> King of <hi>Negropont</hi> made fires,
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:54441:143"/>
that the <hi>Grecian</hi> Army returning from <hi>Troy,</hi> might by the light thereof arrive ſafely at the Haven. There was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly three cities in the Iſle, which made it famous, <hi>Ellopia, Hiſtiaea</hi> and <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raeus</hi> Cities, that were joyned together by reaſon of their vicinity.</p>
                     <p>The Capital City of the Kingdom of <hi>Negropont</hi> was at firſt called in the <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi> Tongue <hi>Calcis;</hi> and then it took the name of the Kingdom it ſelf. It was once the ſeat of a Biſhop, <hi>Suffragan</hi> to the Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Athens;</hi> afterwards 'twas raiſed to an Arch-Biſhoprick.</p>
                     <p>'Tis ſituated on the banks of the <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ripus:</hi> The compaſs of its walls is about two miles, but there are more houſes and people in the Suburbs, where the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> dwell, than in the City, inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited by <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Jews.</hi> The <hi>Turks</hi> have there two Moſques, and two o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers without, where the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> alſo have their Churches. The <hi>Jews</hi> have an houſe, where they inſtruct the Youth. All the Inhabitants make about 15000. The City is divided from the Suburbs by a great Ditch with a flat bottom, in a ſmooth and even ground.</p>
                     <p>There is a Captain <hi>Baſha</hi> that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:54441:143"/>
the whole Iſle, and part of <hi>Boeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia,</hi> who has in his abſence his Kiaja or Lieutenant, and his Subkiaja. There is alſo a Bey or Lord, who has ſome Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues, and is obliged to maintain a Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley. At the place where the ſtrait of the <hi>Euripus</hi> is narroweſt to paſs over into the Iſle, they go over a ſtone bridge of five little Arches not above thirty paces long, and ſo under a Tower in the middle of the Channel, built by the <hi>Venetians,</hi> where St. <hi>Mark</hi> is yet ſeen over the Gate. From the Tower to the City is but one Draw-bridge about twenty paces long, built on ſharp bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomed boats, which is raiſed half to the Tower, and the other half to the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, to give paſſage to the Galleys and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Veſſels, which cannot eaſily be done without taking in their Oars.</p>
                     <p>There is alſo to be ſeen the Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal City, at preſent called <hi>Cariſſo,</hi> once <hi>Chironia,</hi> which <hi>Strabo</hi> names <hi>Cariſtus</hi> and <hi>Cariſtos, Sophianus Caſtel Roſſo,</hi> and the <hi>French Chateauroux,</hi> it acknowledges <hi>Calcis</hi> for its Metropolis, being ſixty miles diſtant. It ſtands near <hi>Cape Caefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reo.</hi> There was beſides another Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal City <hi>Eretria,</hi> which <hi>Moletius</hi> calls
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:54441:144"/>
                        <hi>Rocho,</hi> which in his time was not leſs famous than <hi>Calcis,</hi> which once was an <hi>Athenian</hi> Colony built on the banks of the <hi>Euripus</hi> before the firſt deſtruction of <hi>Troy:</hi> both theſe Cities have periſht by the falſneſs of their own Inhabitants; So that now their names only remain: They were once pillaged and burnt by <hi>Darius.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The ſoil of the Iſle is ſtony and ſandy, but this is only upon the top, for digging deeper they find it very good. There are ſeveral Foreſts, where good ſhip timber may be cut. Near <hi>Cariſtus</hi> is a Mountain of the ſame name of very beautiful marble: And near to it is found the <hi>Asbeſtos</hi> ſtone, which may be ſpun and made into cloth, which by put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in the fire grows white. There were formerly in the Territory of <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis</hi> Iron and copper Mines, which are now loſt. The Iſle produces cotton e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to make Sails for a great Navy. There are ſeveral hot baths. It is wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered with two Rivers, <hi>Fimileus</hi> and <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reus,</hi> of which the Poets ſaid, that one made the Sheep have black wool, the other white. In ſine the Iſle abounds in all things; and Pope <hi>Pius</hi> the fifth ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed ſeveral great Captains to go and
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:54441:144"/>
begin the War with the <hi>Turk</hi> in this Kingdom; becauſe it is capable of main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining a whole Army, beſides it has good Ports on the ſide of the Continent. It is true indeed, that when one is once there, he can by no means get out to ſave himſelf. There are ſeveral places on the South part, the moſt conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble whereof is called <hi>Spiritus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>When <hi>Pietro Zani</hi> was Doge, the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick inlarged their Dominions by this beautiful Kingdom, which was yielded to them by the Emperor of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople,</hi> as a reward for the good ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices they had done him. The firſt Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour that was ſent was <hi>Pictro Barbo,</hi> named <hi>il Zanco.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anno</hi> 1469. the <hi>Turks</hi> attempting the Conqueſt of it, came with three hundred Sail. At firſt they made a Bridge upon the <hi>Euripus,</hi> that ſo they might land their Troops upon the Campaign of the Iſle; but thoſe of the Country ſo vigorouſly oppoſed them, that they were forced to return to their Galleys. Within a a Month <hi>Mahomet</hi> came himſelf with an Army of twelve thouſand Men: He made a new Bridge over the Channel, from the Church of St. <hi>Mark,</hi> a mile off
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:54441:145"/>
of the City, and by this means made himſelf a way to attach <hi>Negropent.</hi> This City was in ſome ſort fortified at that time, and had in it in Garriſon twenty four thouſand Men under <hi>Ludo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vico Calbo</hi> and <hi>Paolo Erizzo</hi> Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders. The laſt had been Governour of the City, and tho his time was expired, yet he would not leave the place, when he might contribute by his Arms and Counſel, to its defence, and ſignalize his zeal for the Service of his Country. The <hi>Turks</hi> raiſed ſeveral Batteries in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers places, and continually plaid upon the Walls. And four times march'd to the aſſault, where four thouſand <hi>Turks</hi> were killed. The Place was beſieged by Sea and Land, and extremely preſſed on all hands; yet the beſieged ſtill defended themſelves with advantage, and had already ſuſtained a months Siege, when a treaſonable practice was diſcovered. For a little Girl found a letter, wherein was mentioned the means and way of delivering up the place to the <hi>Ottomans.</hi> This letter was directed to <hi>Thomaſo Schiava. Luigi Delfino</hi> tranſported with indignation againſt the Traitor, attacked him
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:54441:145"/>
openly, and by meer force made him diſcover all the baſe Intrigues he had with the <hi>Turks.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The beſieged ſtill animated more and more in their defence, gave daily nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble proofs of their courage and conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; but at laſt they were almoſt wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried out with continual labour and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigue. In theſe extremeties, they, who had the Guard of <hi>Porte Bureliana,</hi> ran a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from their Poſt, and left the place the twelfth of <hi>July,</hi> 1649.</p>
                     <p>The Enemy ſoon perceiving the place deſerted, and the entrance of the Gate free for them, entered the Town, and gave in all places dreadful marks of their Barbarity. <hi>Calbo</hi> was killed in the Place, and <hi>Bondulmiero</hi> in his houſe. <hi>Paolo Erizzo</hi> beeing retrenched in an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous Poſt valiantly defended him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and the <hi>Sultan</hi> promiſed him life if he would deliver himſelf up, which having done the cruel <hi>Turk</hi> broke his word, and cauſed him to be ſawed in two. One of his Daughters a very beautiful Virgin choſe rather to be ſtabb'd than receive the Sultans careſſes. All were murdered above twenty years old. This done <hi>Mahomet</hi> left the City
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:54441:146"/>
with a Garriſon for the Guard of the whole Iſle and Kingdom.</p>

                  <p>THe <hi>Euripus</hi> is a ſtrait of the <hi>Egaean</hi> Sea, ſo narrow, that ſcarce one Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley can paſs it (under a Bridge that is made over it) between the Cittadel and the Tower or Dungeon of <hi>Negro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pont.</hi> It has been called <hi>Euripus Eubolcus,</hi> from the old name of the Iſle, or <hi>Ghal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidicus</hi> from the ancient City <hi>Chalcis;</hi> the <hi>Latins</hi> named it <hi>Euripus,</hi> thoſe of the place <hi>Egripos,</hi> the <hi>Italians Stretto di Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greponte,</hi> and the <hi>French l' Euripe de Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidoine,</hi> or <hi>le detroit de l' Euripe.</hi> It is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout ſixty miles long with little Gulfs in divers places.</p>
                  <p>Its Ebb and Flow is doubtleſs one of the greateſt wonders in the World, and it is fabled, that <hi>Aristotle</hi> drowned himſelf in it out of grief that he could not find out the cauſe thereof.</p>

                     <hi>Antiphilus,</hi> a Native of <hi>Bizantium,</hi> ſays in a Greek <hi>Epigram,</hi> that the <hi>Euri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus</hi> riſes and falls ſix times; <hi>Strabo, Pli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi>

                     <hi>Pomponius Mela</hi> aſſures us, that this is done fourteen times a day, tho it ſeems by his words, that he means, that the <hi>Euripus</hi> continually ebbs and flows four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen times in 24 hours.

                     <hi>Seneca</hi> ſeems to be of the ſame Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in one of his Tragedies, where he thus ſpeaks:</p>
                  <q>Euripus undas flectit inſtabilis vagas, Septemque curſus flectit, &amp; totidem refert Dum laſſa Titan mergat Oceano Juga.</q>

                  <l>While <hi>Titan</hi> drives his weary Steeds to reſt.</l>
                  <p>It ſeems alſo that <hi>Pliny</hi> would expreſs the ſame, that it flows and ebbs ſeven times a day, and as often at night, though his words are not very clear. <hi>Quorumdam Aestuariorum privata natura eſt, velut Taurominitani ſaepius et in Euboea ſepties die ac nocte reciprocantis:</hi> That is, <hi>there are Currents of a very peculiar Nature, as that of the Taurominians, which often goes, and returns, and that of the</hi> Euripus, <hi>which does ſo ſeven times in a day and night.</hi>

<pb n="215" facs="tcp:54441:147"/>
Current; for this ebbing and flowing, does not at all diſorder the Veſſels, which have room enough to keep them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from the Current, either in the great Port, which is covered with the walls of the Cittadel, or in that on the other ſide of the Bridge, as Father <hi>Babin</hi> the Jeſuit obſerved, <hi>Anno</hi> 1669. when the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Navy wintered at <hi>Negropont.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The ſame Father, conſidered the courſe of the <hi>Euripus,</hi> at ſeveral times.

Such are the Terms, they uſe at <hi>Negropont,</hi> to deſcribe this wonder of Nature.</p>
                  <p>It is in its force and vigour, or to ſpeak plainer, it is regular from the three laſts days of the old Moon, till the eighth of the new, and on the ninth 'tis irregular and broken, and remains ſo troubled, till the thirteenth inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively.

                     <p>So each Moon there is eleven days of irregularity, and 18 or 19 others, that are regular. It is then irregular from the firſt Quarter, to about the full Moon, and after the laſt Quarter it begins a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain to be irregular.</p>
                     <p>During the time of its Irregularity in one natural day, that is, in twenty four or twenty five hours, there is eleven, twelve, thirteen, and ſometimes four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen Floods and Ebbs, according to the obſervations of the ſame Father; and as thoſe aſſure us, that are daily at the Mills, and find the wheels alter often in a day, as the Stream turns. So that the Flood does not come only ſeven times in a day, as the Ancients wrote, but much frequenter.</p>
                     <p>When the Courſe of the <hi>Euripus</hi> is regular for the other eighteen or
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:54441:149"/>
nineteen days; 'tis like the Ocean, and Gulf of <hi>Venice,</hi> that is in twenty four, or twenty five hours, it has but two Floods and Ebbs, and every day retards it one hour; as in the Ocean, it is ſix hours coming in, and as long going out, whether in Summer, or whether the wind be violent or calm. On the irregular days, it flows about half an hour, and ebbs three quarters of an hour.</p>
                     <p>All the Tides of the <hi>Euripus,</hi> whether regular, or irregular, differ in two parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars, from thoſe of the Ocean; firſt, that in high water, it riſes not above one Foot, and very rarely two, whereas the Ocean riſes ſometimes eighty cubits, as in the Ports of <hi>Britain,</hi> though in the Iſles of <hi>America,</hi> it mounts not high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, than in the <hi>Euripus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The other difference, is that in the Ocean, when the water ſinks and abates, it retires into the deep Sea, as on the contrary, it raiſes it ſelf, and covers more ground, when it approaches the ſides. The <hi>Euripus</hi> is quite after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther manner, for its Flood happens, when its waters run towards the Iſles of the <hi>Archipelago,</hi> where is a much
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:54441:149"/>
greater Sea; and its Ebb is when it runs towards <hi>Theſſaly,</hi> and through the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel, by which the Galleys paſs to go towards <hi>Theſſalonica,</hi> as a ſhorter and ſafer way to <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Between high and low water, there is a ſhort interval, when the water ſeems quiet and ſtill, and like ſtanding wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſo that ſtraws and feathers lie upon the water without motion, provided there be no wind.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Caeſar d' Arcons,</hi> who printed in <hi>French</hi> a Book in <hi>Quarto,</hi> concerning the Ebb and Flow of the Sea, has a particular Paragraph of the Tides of the <hi>Euripus.</hi>

                     <p>THE Gulf of <hi>Salonichi</hi> has an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of 140 Miles length; it is bounded by a very beautiful Plain, whence it is neceſſarily expoſed to the Winds, and therefore very dangerous to the Sea-man<hi>:</hi> In that Place where it moſt wears away the Land, is a very advantageous and ſpacious Port. There
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:54441:153"/>
is ſituated, partly on an Hill, and partly on a Declivity, as the Ground goes, the famous City of <hi>Macedonia,</hi> called uſually <hi>Salonichi,</hi> or otherwiſe <hi>Theſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonique;</hi> near it, on the Weſt ſide, glides down the River <hi>Vardar,</hi> which <hi>Ptole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my</hi> and <hi>Strabo</hi> call <hi>Axius Fluvius,</hi> others <hi>Bardarus</hi> and <hi>Bardarius Fluvius,</hi> very full of Fiſh, and its Banks covered and adorned with goodly Trees. The Walls of the City are flanked with ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Towers, and as to its circuit ſome make it ten, others twelve miles. It has three Forts to defend it; the firſt, being the leaſt, comes firſt in view at the Entrance or Landing-Place at ſome diſtance from the old City; 'tis Mouted with 20 great Guns. The two others are ſituated within View of the Sea, at the higheſt Part of the Wall, furniſhed with 30 or 40 Cannon; on the Land ſide is a Fortreſs like that of the ſeven Towers at <hi>Conſtantinople;</hi> this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands the whole Town, being built on a little Hill, at the Foot whereof is a very great Number of Houſes making a Suburbs, encompaſſed with a Wall apart, but which joyns to the City.</p>
                     <p>There are in this place a numerous

People, and the great Number of Habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations that are built in the Plain are but low and baſe, and not ſufficient to contain the great Numbers of <hi>Jews</hi> that dwell in them: Beſides they are not a little incommoded by the horrid ſtink that is in the Streets, they are ſo narrow.</p>
                     <p>There is a conſiderable Trade, as well from the commodiouſneſs of its Situation, as for the great Quantity of Silk, Wool, Skins of all ſorts, Wax, Gun-powder, Corn, Cotton, and Iron.

There are in it 48 Moſques, in which is comprehended the Church of St. <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metrius,</hi> of three Iles, born up with very fair Pillars, where St. <hi>Paul</hi> Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched once; and that of St. <hi>Sophia,</hi> built by the Emperour, <hi>Juſtinian,</hi> thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Greek Churches, thirty ſix great Synagogues, and many other ſmall ones.
