            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

of the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Army, and we lo≈øt but forty of our Men, yet all the≈øe lo≈ø≈øes would not abate the Turki≈øh Pride, and bring them to yield; for they knew where to gather a recruit of fre≈øh Troops, and omitted not daily to di≈øturb the <hi>Venetians</hi> in their Tren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches.

                  <p>In the end this prudent Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der finding the only means to reduce the place, was to force the Enemys Camp, propo≈øed the De≈øign to the Council of War, which was appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of by them.

                  <p>Twilight of the next Morning be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing come, two Barrels of Powder were fired, as a Signal, which was immediately followed with a di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of all the Cannon, and ≈øurious Salvo of all the Musketeers, with a continual ≈øiring on the Front and Flank of the Enemies Camp.

The Turks ≈øhew the≈øe Tails as a ≈øign of their Re≈øolution, to make new Levies, and that a great Army will march; and afterwards they give them to him that is to be the Commander in chief, as a ≈øign of good Augury.

                     <p>ON the We≈øt of the <hi>Archipelago</hi> lies the I≈øle at this day commonly called <hi>Cerigo.

It has ≈øeveral Rocks roundabout it, and good Ports on its ≈øides. On the South is the Port of the Fortre≈øs, which is but little frequented, becau≈øe 'tis but a narrow Bay, and lies much ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øed to the winds: The other, which is on the other ≈øide the <hi>Dragoniers,</hi> twelve miles from the Fortre≈øs, has a good bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom, is deep, and will contain a great Fleet: Above all things the natural ≈øhape of the Bay is wonderful, which may be ≈øhut up, and where forty Galleys may lie in ≈øafety. There is a Church dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to St. <hi>Nicholas,</hi> though no body dwells there. On the We≈øt at 25 miles di≈øtance from this Port, there is another little one called <hi>San Nicolo de modari,</hi>
                        <pb n="180" facs="tcp:54441:126"/>
proper for <hi>Galliots</hi> and ≈ømall Barks, where is al≈øo a Church dedicated to St. <hi>Nicholas.</hi>

                     <p>There is in this I≈øle great quantities of wild fowl, but little corn, wine or oyl; and food is there very dear. There are ≈øeveral Villages, but of ≈ømall or no account: And ≈øome Mona≈øteries of <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>romonachi</hi> and <hi>Caloierros,</hi> of which one ≈øtands upon a Rock on the right ≈øide near to the Fortre≈øs, which they call <hi>San Giovanni della Grotta.</hi> It has been hewn out of the Rock by pure labour with the mattock.

                     <p>The City of the ≈øame name with the I≈øle has the Title of a Bi≈øhoprick: It ≈øtands upon a ≈øteep Rock in a very ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous ≈øituation, having towards the Sea an E≈øplanade well mounted

                     <p>Some fabulous Writers ≈øay, that the Godde≈øs <hi>Venus</hi> had her Birth in this place, others that ≈øhe pa≈ø≈øed her fir≈øt days there.

adorning her head, the third waited on her behind. Her Son <hi>Cupid</hi> was before her, armed with his bow, who, tho blind, yet wounded the God of Light, <hi>Apollo,</hi> with an Arrow from his bow.</p>
                     <p>'Twas in this Temple, that <hi>Paris,</hi> the amourous Son of <hi>Priam,</hi> met the fair <hi>Grecian Helen;</hi> and here they tempted each other to the fatal Rape, which armed the jealous <hi>Menelaus,</hi> and revenging <hi>Greece</hi> for the utter de≈øtruction of <hi>Troy.</hi>

                     <p>The I≈øle is of no great extent, being not above ≈øixty miles; yet 'twas of great con≈øequence to the <hi>Spar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans,</hi> when they were Ma≈øters of it; for it was to them as it were a Rampart and a ≈øhelter to their ≈øhips, which they ≈øent to <hi>Aegypt.</hi> They ≈øent thither eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry year a Pre≈øident to regulate civil and military affairs; and the keeping of this I≈øle was then ≈øo nece≈ø≈øary, that in the eighth year of the <hi>Peleponne≈øian</hi> War, the <hi>Athenians</hi> having won it, <hi>Sparta</hi> was without defence, and its Country lay open to the Enemy, till they ha≈øted to fortifie and put Garri≈øons in the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring places.</p>

King <hi>Cecrops</hi> fir≈øt laid the Foundations, and called it from his own name <hi>Cecropia;</hi> but its perfection was owing to <hi>The≈øeus,</hi> who enlarged it, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liging tho≈øe in the Country to come and dwell there. The Cittadel ≈øtill kept the name of <hi>Cecropia,</hi> till at la≈øt 'twas named <hi>Acropolis.</hi> 'Tis built up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a living Rock precipitious on all ≈øides, except on the We≈øt where the entrance is. The Ea≈øt and South walls make two ≈øides of a Square, the re≈øt is not ≈øo regular, but an≈øwers to the Points and Windings of the Rock. 'Tis a thou≈øand two hundred ordinary paces round; but at the bottom of the Hill plainly appear the Foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of another wall, which encompa≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øed it almo≈øt round, and rendred it the more difficult to ≈øcale. The Souldiers

of the Garri≈øon are in pay during their whole Lives, and dwell there with their Families. They ≈øtill are upon the watch again≈øt all ≈øurpri≈øe, by rea≈øon of the frequent inroads of the Pirats. The Cittadel is almo≈øt at an equal di≈øtance, between two high Hills; one of an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual height with it on the South-We≈øt, about a Falconet ≈øhot off, is called <hi>Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øeum;</hi> the other is Mount <hi>Anche≈ømus,</hi> which is ≈øo rugged, that 'twere hard to plant a Battery of great Guns there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on again≈øt the City and Cittadel; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øides there is no Plain upon it, only ≈øharp Points of the Rock; upon one of which is the Chapel of <hi>Agis Georgios,</hi> where once ≈øtood the Statue of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che≈ømian Jupiter.</hi> The lower part of the Town is on the North of the Citta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del, and when one comes from the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards it is ≈øo covered by it that the Hou≈øes of the Cittadel only can be ≈øeen, whence ≈øeveral, not having the curio≈øity to land, have thought, that of all the Grandure of <hi>Athens</hi> the Ca≈øtle only now remained. This Situation is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry advantageons for it, as to the health of its Inhabitants; for the Climate be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hot, 'tis much better to lie open to

the refre≈øhing North Winds, than to the Southern Burnings.</p>
                     <p>After all its Revolutions there is yet to be ≈øeen very fine Antiquities, the chief whereof are, the Temple of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory of the <hi>Ionick</hi> Order; which the <hi>Turks</hi> make now their Magazin of Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</p>
                     <p>The Ar≈øenal of <hi>Licurgus</hi> of the <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick</hi> Order, in which they lay up their Arms and Artillery.</p>
                     <p>The Temple of <hi>Minerva</hi> of the <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick</hi> Order changed now into a <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metan</hi> Mo≈øque.</p>
                     <p>The Lantern of <hi>Demo≈øthenes,</hi> now ≈øerving as a Receptacle to the <hi>P. P.</hi> Capuchins.</p>
                     <p>The Tower of the Winds of an Octogonal Figure, whereof <hi>Androni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus Cyrrhe≈øtes</hi> gave the Model, and <hi>Vitru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vius</hi> has de≈øcribed.</p>
                     <p>The Temple of <hi>The≈øeus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Foundations of <hi>Areopagus, &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>There is in <hi>Athens</hi> eight or nine thou≈øand Inhabitants, three quarters whereof are <hi>Greeks,</hi> and the re≈øt <hi>Turks,</hi> who have four Mo≈øques in the City, and a fifth in the Ca≈øtle. No <hi>Jews</hi> are permitted there, for the <hi>Athenians</hi>
                        <pb n="200" facs="tcp:54441:139"/>
are as cunning as they, whence the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb, <hi>God defend us from the</hi> Jews <hi>of</hi> Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonica, <hi>the</hi> Greeks <hi>of</hi> Athens, <hi>and the</hi> Turks <hi>of</hi> Negropont.</p>
                     <p>The Habit of the <hi>Greeks</hi> of <hi>Athens</hi> is very different from that of the <hi>Turks,</hi> for they wear only ≈øtrait Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of black, or ≈øome dark Colours.</p>
                     <p>The City at pre≈øent is divided into eight Parts, called <hi>Platomata,</hi> which are</p>

Some have thought that this I≈øle was once joyned to <hi>Boeotia,</hi> and thence ≈øepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated by Earth-quakes; or as others ≈øay, by the ≈øwift and impetuous cour≈øe of the waves, which make the Canal called <hi>Euripus.</hi> The I≈øle is three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred ≈øixty five miles round, in length, from <hi>South</hi> to <hi>North</hi> ninety miles, and forty broad, and twenty in the narrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>e≈øt part.

                     <p>The Capital City of the Kingdom of <hi>Negropont</hi> was at fir≈øt called in the <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi> Tongue <hi>Calcis;</hi> and then it took the name of the Kingdom it ≈øelf.

There is al≈øo a Bey or Lord, who has ≈øome Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues, and is obliged to maintain a Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley. At the place where the ≈øtrait of the <hi>Euripus</hi> is narrowe≈øt to pa≈øs over into the I≈øle, they go over a ≈øtone bridge of five little Arches not above thirty paces long, and ≈øo under a Tower in the middle of the Channel, built by the <hi>Venetians,</hi> where St. <hi>Mark</hi> is yet ≈øeen over the Gate.

                     <p>The ≈øoil of the I≈øle is ≈øtony and ≈øandy, but this is only upon the top, for digging deeper they find it very good. There are ≈øeveral Fore≈øts, where good ≈øhip timber may be cut. Near <hi>Cari≈øtus</hi> is a Mountain of the ≈øame name of very beautiful marble: And near to it is found the <hi>Asbe≈øtos</hi> ≈øtone, which may be ≈øpun and made into cloth, which by put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in the fire grows white. There were formerly in the Territory of <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis</hi> Iron and copper Mines, which are now lo≈øt. The I≈øle produces cotton e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to make Sails for a great Navy. There are ≈øeveral hot baths.

begin the War with the <hi>Turk</hi> in this Kingdom; becau≈øe it is capable of main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining a whole Army, be≈øides it has good Ports on the ≈øide of the Continent.

                     <p>When <hi>Pietro Zani</hi> was Doge, the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick inlarged their Dominions by this beautiful Kingdom, which was yielded to them by the Emperor of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtantinople,</hi> as a reward for the good ≈øer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices they had done him.

                        <hi>Anno</hi> 1469. the <hi>Turks</hi> attempting the Conque≈øt of it, came with three hundred Sail. At fir≈øt they made a Bridge upon the <hi>Euripus,</hi> that ≈øo they might land their Troops upon the Campaign of the I≈øle; but tho≈øe of the Country ≈øo vigorou≈øly oppo≈øed them, that they were forced to return to their Galleys. Within a a Month <hi>Mahomet</hi> came him≈øelf with an Army of twelve thou≈øand Men: He made a new Bridge over the Channel, from the Church of St. <hi>Mark,</hi> a mile off
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:54441:145"/>
of the City, and by this means made him≈øelf a way to attach <hi>Negropent.</hi> This City was in ≈øome ≈øort fortified at that time, and had in it in Garri≈øon twenty four thou≈øand Men under <hi>Ludo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vico Calbo</hi> and <hi>Paolo Erizzo</hi> Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders. The la≈øt had been Governour of the City, and tho his time was expired, yet he would not leave the place, when he might contribute by his Arms and Coun≈øel, to its defence, and ≈øignalize his zeal for the Service of his Country. The <hi>Turks</hi> rai≈øed ≈øeveral Batteries in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers places, and continually plaid upon the Walls. And four times march'd to the a≈ø≈øault, where four thou≈øand <hi>Turks</hi> were killed. The Place was be≈øieged by Sea and Land, and extremely pre≈ø≈øed on all hands; yet the be≈øieged ≈øtill defended them≈øelves with advantage, and had already ≈øu≈øtained a months Siege, when a trea≈øonable practice was di≈øcovered. For a little Girl found a letter, wherein was mentioned the means and way of delivering up the place to the <hi>Ottomans.</hi> This letter was directed to <hi>Thoma≈øo Schiava. Luigi Delfino</hi> tran≈øported with indignation again≈øt the Traitor, attacked him
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:54441:145"/>
openly, and by meer force made him di≈øcover all the ba≈øe Intrigues he had with the <hi>Turks.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The be≈øieged ≈øtill animated more and more in their defence, gave daily nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble proofs of their courage and con≈øtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; but at la≈øt they were almo≈øt wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried out with continual labour and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigue. In the≈øe extremeties, they, who had the Guard of <hi>Porte Bureliana,</hi> ran a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from their Po≈øt, and left the place the twelfth of <hi>July,</hi> 1649.</p>
                     <p>The Enemy ≈øoon perceiving the place de≈øerted, and the entrance of the Gate free for them, entered the Town, and gave in all places dreadful marks of their Barbarity. <hi>Calbo</hi> was killed in the Place, and <hi>Bondulmiero</hi> in his hou≈øe. <hi>Paolo Erizzo</hi> beeing retrenched in an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous Po≈øt valiantly defended him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelf, and the <hi>Sultan</hi> promi≈øed him life if he would deliver him≈øelf up, which having done the cruel <hi>Turk</hi> broke his word, and cau≈øed him to be ≈øawed in two. One of his Daughters a very beautiful Virgin cho≈øe rather to be ≈øtabb'd than receive the Sultans care≈ø≈øes. All were murdered above twenty years old. This done <hi>Mahomet</hi> left the City

                     <p>So each Moon there is eleven days of irregularity, and 18 or 19 others, that are regular. It is then irregular from the fir≈øt Quarter, to about the full Moon, and after the la≈øt Quarter it begins a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain to be irregular.</p>
                     <p>During the time of its Irregularity in one natural day, that is, in twenty four or twenty five hours, there is eleven, twelve, thirteen, and ≈øometimes four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen Floods and Ebbs, according to the ob≈øervations of the ≈øame Father; and as tho≈øe a≈ø≈øure us, that are daily at the Mills, and find the wheels alter often in a day, as the Stream turns. So that the Flood does not come only ≈øeven times in a day, as the Ancients wrote, but much frequenter.</p>
                     <p>When the Cour≈øe of the <hi>Euripus</hi> is regular for the other eighteen or
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:54441:149"/>
nineteen days; 'tis like the Ocean, and Gulf of <hi>Venice,</hi> that is in twenty four, or twenty five hours, it has but two Floods and Ebbs, and every day retards it one hour; as in the Ocean, it is ≈øix hours coming in, and as long going out, whether in Summer, or whether the wind be violent or calm. On the irregular days, it flows about half an hour, and ebbs three quarters of an hour.</p>
                     <p>All the Tides of the <hi>Euripus,</hi> whether regular, or irregular, differ in two parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars, from tho≈øe of the Ocean; fir≈øt, that in high water, it ri≈øes not above one Foot, and very rarely two, whereas the Ocean ri≈øes ≈øometimes eighty cubits, as in the Ports of <hi>Britain,</hi> though in the I≈øles of <hi>America,</hi> it mounts not high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, than in the <hi>Euripus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The other difference, is that in the Ocean, when the water ≈øinks and abates, it retires into the deep Sea, as on the contrary, it rai≈øes it ≈øelf, and covers more ground, when it approaches the ≈øides. The <hi>Euripus</hi> is quite after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther manner, for its Flood happens, when its waters run towards the I≈øles of the <hi>Archipelago,</hi> where is a much
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:54441:149"/>
greater Sea; and its Ebb is when it runs towards <hi>The≈ø≈øaly,</hi> and through the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel, by which the Galleys pa≈øs to go towards <hi>The≈ø≈øalonica,</hi> as a ≈øhorter and ≈øafer way to <hi>Con≈øtantinople.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Between high and low water, there is a ≈øhort interval, when the water ≈øeems quiet and ≈øtill, and like ≈øtanding wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ≈øo that ≈øtraws and feathers lie upon the water without motion, provided there be no wind.</p>

                     <p>THE Gulf of <hi>Salonichi</hi> has an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of 140 Miles length; it is bounded by a very beautiful Plain, whence it is nece≈ø≈øarily expo≈øed to the Winds, and therefore very dangerous to the Sea-man<hi>:</hi> In that Place where it mo≈øt wears away the Land, is a very advantageous and ≈øpacious Port. There
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:54441:153"/>
is ≈øituated, partly on an Hill, and partly on a Declivity, as the Ground goes, the famous City of <hi>Macedonia,</hi> called u≈øually <hi>Salonichi,</hi> or otherwi≈øe <hi>The≈ø≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonique;</hi> near it, on the We≈øt ≈øide, glides down the River <hi>Vardar,</hi> which <hi>Ptole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my</hi> and <hi>Strabo</hi> call <hi>Axius Fluvius,</hi> others <hi>Bardarus</hi> and <hi>Bardarius Fluvius,</hi> very full of Fi≈øh, and its Banks covered and adorned with goodly Trees. The Walls of the City are flanked with ≈øeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Towers, and as to its circuit ≈øome make it ten, others twelve miles. It has three Forts to defend it; the fir≈øt, being the lea≈øt, comes fir≈øt in view at the Entrance or Landing-Place at ≈øome di≈øtance from the old City; 'tis Mouted with 20 great Guns. The two others are ≈øituated within View of the Sea, at the highe≈øt Part of the Wall, furni≈øhed with 30 or 40 Cannon; on the Land ≈øide is a Fortre≈øs like that of the ≈øeven Towers at <hi>Con≈øtantinople;</hi> this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands the whole Town, being built on a little Hill, at the Foot whereof is a very great Number of Hou≈øes making a Suburbs, encompa≈ø≈øed with a Wall apart, but which joyns to the City.</p>
                     <p>There are in this place a numerous
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:54441:154"/>
People, and the great Number of Habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations that are built in the Plain are but low and ba≈øe, and not ≈øufficient to contain the great Numbers of <hi>Jews</hi> that dwell in them: Be≈øides they are not a little incommoded by the horrid ≈øtink that is in the Streets, they are ≈øo narrow.</p>
                     <p>There is a con≈øiderable Trade, as well from the commodiou≈øne≈øs of its Situation, as for the great Quantity of Silk, Wool, Skins of all ≈øorts, Wax, Gun-powder, Corn, Cotton, and Iron. The <hi>Jews</hi> mo≈øt bu≈øy them≈øelves in Traffick, and have to them≈øelves the Manufacture of Stuffs to cloath the Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizaries; and by this means they find a Way to employ the Tribute they are obliged to pay the Grand Seignior. There are in it 48 Mo≈øques, in which is comprehended the Church of St. <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metrius,</hi> of three Iles, born up with very fair Pillars, where St. <hi>Paul</hi> Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched once; and that of St. <hi>Sophia,</hi> built by the Emperour, <hi>Ju≈øtinian,</hi> thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Greek Churches, thirty ≈øix great Synagogues, and many other ≈ømall ones. The Governour has the Title of <hi>Mul√†,</hi> and his Place makes him very con≈øiderable at the Port.</p>
